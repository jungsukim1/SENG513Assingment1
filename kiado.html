        <h2>Crew Structure</h2>
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>All-Stars</li>
                <h4>The All-Stars are the crew's top executives, second only to Kaidou himself in rank, authority, and battle prowess, and serve as Kaidou's handpicked, close confidants and protectors.</h4>
                <li>Tobiroppo</li>
                <h4>The Tobiroppo are a special group of the six strongest Shinuchi.</h4>
                <li>Shinuchi</li>
                <h4>The Shinuchi are the crew's second-grade officers — most of whom are elite Gifters — who are responsible for leading the Waiters, Pleasures, and lower Gifters.</h4>
                <li>Gifters</li>
                <h4>The Gifters are the crew's elite soldiers, comprised of nearly 500 Artificial Zoan users.</h4>
                <li>Armoured Divison</li>
                <h4>The Armored Division is a group of Gifters led by Sasaki of the Tobiroppo. True to their name, they wield powerful defenses thanks to their armored-type SMILE abilities (based on hard-shelled/skinned animals such as rhinos, scorpions, and urchins), on top of bazookas for offense and seemingly steel-made ballistic shields for additional protection.</h4>
                <li>Pleasures</li>
                <h4>The Pleasures are the crew's mid-level foot soldiers, only above the Waiters. While having been found worthy of eating SMILE fruits at some point, they are the unfortunate many who failed to gain any animal traits after eating one, being in the 90% who ate dud fruits</h4>
                <li>Waiters</li>
                <h4>The Waiters are the crew's low-level foot soldiers who have yet to eat the SMILEs, still waiting for their chance to gain animal powers (hence their name)</h4>
                <li>Numbers</li>
                <h4>The Numbers are a group of ten former science subjects who underwent Gigantification experiments on Punk Hazard in order to recreate the ancient giant race but were deemed failures for some reason.</h4>
                <li>Marys</li>
                <h4>The Marys are the Beasts Pirates' surveillance force. They consist of both humans and cyborg animals, all of which have a special paper mask with an eye shape on it covering their face, with whatever is beneath letting them transmit everything they see and hear to other Marys.</h4>
