        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <div>
            <h4>The Big Mom Pirates[1] are an extremely infamous and powerful pirate crew led by the former Emperor Charlotte Linlin, better known as "Big Mom", and they are in control of the powerful nation of Totto Land, with their captain ruling it as its queen and their base of operations being Whole Cake Island, the country's main island. The captain agreed to an alliance with the Beasts Pirates for plans to take over the world.[7] However, the captain was defeated during the Raid on Onigashima by two members of the Worst Generation, leaving the crew's status unknown.</h4>

        <h2>Crew Structure</h2>
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>3 Sweet Commanders</li>
                <h4>They serve as Big Mom's top officers with the highest authority, reverence, and fighting prowess in the crew after Big Mom herself.</h4>
                <li>Officers</li>
                <h4>Excluding the Three Sweet Commanders, 74 out of Big Mom's 85 children are confirmed officers of the Big Mom Pirates and considered among the elite of Big Mom's army.</h4>
                <li>Combatants</li>
                <h4>If combatants prove themselves to be trustworthy, they are assigned a rank. No family members, with the technical exception of Capone Bege, have an appointed rank, which may indicate that the ranking system is designed specifically for crew members that are not related to Big Mom by blood.</h4>
                <li>Homies</li>
                <h4>Big Mom uses her Devil Fruit, the Soru Soru no Mi, to create an army of obedient soldiers called "Homies". These homies can be separated into three groups: the Special Homies, which are born out of Big Mom's soul and consist of Zeus, Prometheus, and Napoleon; the Fighting Homies, which consist of the chess soldiers (Chess Peace Keepers in the Funimation Dub), the biscuit soldiers, and the tarte tanks; and the Decorative Homies, which consist of the many trees, cakes, flowers, chairs, foods, and other objects that have been granted life by Big Mom.</h4>
