        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <div>
            <h4>The Whitebeard Pirates was formerly one of the strongest pirate crews in the world, as their late captain, Whitebeard, was one of the Four Emperors and the only man to have ever been a match for the Pirate King, Gol D. Roger, in a fight.[6] Whitebeard's crew was segmented into divisions, instead of all under their captain's direct command. The crew had multiple subordinate crews operating in the New World, allowing the pirate crew to function as a massive pirate fleet.</h4>

        <h2>Crew Structure</h2>
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>Divison Commanders</li>
                <h4>Though the division commanders all made their appearance in the series, only half of them were directly named in the main storyline. The rest were named in the SBS of Volume 58.[9] It has been stated by Oda that all the Whitebeard commanders, no matter which division they are leading, are all equal in rank and the division number does not indicate their strength.[10] But outside Ace, who was Luffy's brother and thus naturally received a lot of exposure, three of the commanders, Marco, Jozu, and Vista, have been given far more reverence and focus than the others. Each division has specific duties for its members.[11]</h4>
                <li>Subordinate Captains</li>
                <h4>Similar to the Whitebeard Commanders, these New World pirate captains' names were revealed through the anime credits in the episode they were formally featured in, or by Oda through the manga and the fourth databook.</h4>
